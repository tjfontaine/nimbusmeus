NimbusMeus -- Personal Cloud Media Streamer
-------------------------------------------

This simple node.js app is designed to stream your audio or video across
the internet to multiple platforms.

Currently it is designed to work with Apple Live HTTP streaming, and therefore
only works with Safari or Mobile Safari (i.e. any device that runs iOS
[iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch])

It currently also depends on VLC for things to work, you simply need to specify
the path to your installed version in `config.js`
